# Install container dependencies (claude-agent-sdk bundles the full CLI).
# The SDK ships per-platform native binaries as optionalDependencies and its
# resolver checks the musl variant before glibc on Linux. npm 10 doesn't
# filter optional deps by libc, so both binaries get installed and the
# resolver picks the musl one — which the Debian kernel can't exec, surfacing
# as "claude not found". Delete the musl variant so resolver falls through.
